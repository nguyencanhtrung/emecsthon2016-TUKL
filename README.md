A small project was implemented within 48 hours in EMECS-thon 2016 (a competition for Embedded System students 
between 6 universities in Europe)
- Platform: Gecko 3700 starter kit; 
- IDE: Simplicity; 
- Programming language: C

**Topic description** 

The system receives commands and accelerometer data from an Android smartphone.
Basing on the command, it will perform in according operation modes
Basically, the system has 2 operation modes. 
 - Manual mode, movement of the plate is adjusted based on the movement the smartphone (extract data from accelerometer)
 - Automatic mode, performing self-balancing which means the system be able to hold the ball at the center of the plate in every circumstance

  **_Communication part_**
The system communicate with Android smartphones by using an extra bluetooth module (HC-05), 
this module is connected with micro-controller through USART.
  
  **_Sensors and actuators_**
* Infrared sensors and LEDs are used to detect location of a ball.
* Actuators are 2 servomotors which control the angles of plate based on PWM signal generated by micro-controller.

**Achievement**: People Choice Award
